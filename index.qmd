## COURSE FORMAT AND REQUIREMENTS

Each week's two class meetings will blend conceptual lectures with practical, in-class exercises using real datasets. Students are expected to bring a laptop to every class with a fully functional installation of R and RStudio. In-class participation will often involve running code, producing analyses, and interpreting results in real time.

*Readings refer to Applied Survival Analysis Using R (Dirk F. Moore). Class meets Tuesdays and Thursdays. Tuesday, Nov 4: Civic Engagement Day (no class). Last class: Thursday, Dec 4. Final exam period: Dec 9--17, 2025 (date/time TBD).*
